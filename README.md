# DSA_ARRAY_PROJECT

This project was created for my Data Structures and Algorithms course.  
The program uses **basic arrays and loops** (no functions, no classes) to perform several operations based on user choice.

## 📌 Features

- Takes 15 integers from the user  
- Input validation (numbers must be between -10 and 50)  
- Menu-driven program  
- Find the largest number  
- Find the smallest number  
- Calculate the average  
- Display the array in reverse order  
- Show all negative numbers  
- Show all odd numbers  
- Program repeats until the user chooses to quit 
- End
